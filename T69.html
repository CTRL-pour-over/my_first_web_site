  <p id="Lyrics">Lyrics""" this track is called 'collapse' by the way..<br>
    coz when the bass bit kicks in<br>
    and the temp starts slowing down<br>
    its like a collapse of sorts<br>
    i'm gathering visuals references at the mo<br>
    .s there any other point cloud or other references you like i should look<br>
    nope dont think so... I still love ascii visuals also..<br>
    surprised it never got used more but maybe it has, I dont get out much.<br>
    sure,, i'll look into doing 3d ascii point-cloud cross over<br>
    maybe when you get up close to the point cloud it's look more like ascii...<br>
    yeah  i see youl point with midi..<br>
    but you you could just edit tight to the beat manually anyhow can't you ?<br>
    yeah i could,,<br>
    but with your kinda music,, it would take for ever<br>
    what places to include would be relavant in London?<br>
    deff the silver box in elegante and castle<br>
    that ill be one of the focal points in the video,, a bit like the monoih in 20<br>
    collaged within the cornish stuff<br>
    <em>anything else in London?</em><br>
    nah, all crap<br>
    how about sun on cafe next to clissold park, ha<br>
    college stuff, top yeah..<br>
    how quickly they add woods stuff in that star wars thing... crazy realistic<br>
    <strong>Maybe we should do something with political slant in this video<br>
    like how media can manipulate things to make you think</strong><br>
    oh been getting well into simulation theory of late...<br>
    didnt realise a lot of prominent science<br>
    are now saying the chance we are living in base reality<br>
    is about 1billion to one!<br>
    <strong>love it..</strong><br>
    simulations in simulations in simulations..<br>
    for ever probably.. god is just an ai<br>
    don't want to accept it, although i agree it's feasible,, i'd rather think it's ojn<br>
    all these normal people who watch shit like "Britain's got talen" and such<br>
    either proof of it's not a simulation, (cos why would you bother simulating<br>
    or it's proof that we are living in a failed simulation<br>
    i can't see why it would be a problem accepting, i quite like the idea... ha<br>
    i think that's what i hate the most about it,,<br>
    is that it opens the gate for creationism interpretation...<br>
    yeah well science is not much better, can't explain how life started<br>
    or what was before big bang and loads of other stuff,<br>
    just evolution and even that has gaping holes.<br>
    so was just chomping on a peanut butter toastie with sweedish jam... .<br>
    thinking the idea that code i.e. us can imagine something is pretty wild<br>
    code re-writing itself and envisaging the future re-write of itself<br>
    This obviously applies to any act of imagination:<br>
    making something>then observing it >observing it then re-writes the<br>
    as you watch/experience what you made and then repeats if you do it again.<br>
    imagining a future version of itself by imagining what the effects the re-write<br>
    are going to have on you and then adjusting the imagination to give desired effect :)<br>
    mmh what kinda jam was that ? sounds like it was fermented<br>
    or something, to give this inspirations   :   )<br>
    and that tip, i've been well into into Almond butter and manuka honey lately<br>
    anyway, was thinking if was all a sim,, the technology would be so advanced,<br>
    it's probably beyond code ,,,, like many levels steps further analogue-d<br>
    like some semi organic technology like in Existenz.. """<br>
